SonusFX is an open source ultra-minimalistic audio editor/DAW, being developed by [NOBODY Team](https://github.com/NOBODY-Team).

This is the main developer's separate branch, completely independent from the official release. May have a different toolset.

The official complete release can be found [here](https://github.com/NOBODY-Team/SonusFX) later. At this moment, **this is the only available version of SonusFX**.
