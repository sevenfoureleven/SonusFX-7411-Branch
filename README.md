SonusFX is an open source ultra-minimalistic audio editor/DAW, being developed by [NOBODY Team](https://github.com/NOBODY-Team).

This is the main developer's separate branch, completely independent from the official release. May have a different toolset.

The official complete release can be found [here](https://github.com/NOBODY-Team/SonusFX) later. At this moment, **this is the only available version of SonusFX**.

# Source
SonusFX is being developed with the Unity game engine, and by extension, can only be edited with it. This Branch's version of Sonus was made with [Unity 6000.0.13](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/6000.0.13#installs) (URP). The official reposity will contain further information/tutorials of the source, whereas this Branch acts as more of an early release/test version, so does not contain those resources. This version is about >1000 lines of C# code, so the source should not be hard to understand, or edit even without any resources.

Both the source and software, this reposity included, are licensed under [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).
