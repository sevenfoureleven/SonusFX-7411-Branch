# SonusFX-7411-Branch
SonusFX is an open source ultra-minimalistic audio editor/DAW, being developed by [NOBODY Team](https://github.com/NOBODY-Team).

This is the main developer's separate branch, completely independent from the official release. May have a different toolset.

The official complete release can be found [here](https://github.com/NOBODY-Team/SonusFX) later. At this moment, **this is the only available version of SonusFX**.

# Source
SonusFX is being developed with the Unity game engine, and by extension, can only be edited with it. This Branch's version of Sonus was made with [Unity 6000.0.13](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/6000.0.13#installs).
